# `run` / `retest` — executing the campaign

Read `reference/environments.md` first — which environment is selected, and what may be done to it,
is decided there.

Preconditions: `.anantys/qa.md` exists, `qa-plan.md` exists — and, if `qa-plan.md` carries an
`**Under test:**` line, the environment is serving that branch/commit (verified in step 1).

## Run mode — asked once per session

The first `run` or `retest` of a Claude session asks the operator which mode to use, before
preflight — one `AskUserQuestion`, both options described. Reuse that answer for every later `run` /
`retest` in the same session without asking again; `--mode autonomous|interactive` skips the
question and overrides the remembered answer for that call. Never pick a mode yourself.

- **Autonomous** — walk the **whole** plan without stopping on a defect. Record every DEFECT as it
  is found, and at the end write `qa-report.md` exactly as `report` does.
- **Interactive** — stop at the **first new DEFECT** and hand off: close the run (steps 5–6 below),
  write `qa-report.md` exactly as `report` does with the stopping defect listed first, and **print
  that defect's fix brief in full in your reply**, so the operator can paste it into a dev session
  straight from the console. Then stop and wait; the next step is a fix and a `retest`.
  A **new** DEFECT is one that was not already an open defect on this environment before the run.
  A known defect that still fails is recorded, stays in `qa-report.md`, and does not stop the walk —
  otherwise a `retest` would halt on the first unfixed case before reaching its regression-risk set.

Either way, `qa-report.md` covers **every open defect on the environment** — never only this run's.
A report rewritten with one defect silently drops the others from the brief the operator hands on.
An assertion the run did not walk **keeps its previous status** on this environment; stopping early
never resets a result to `not run`.

A **DEFECT** is an assertion that FAILs after the adjudication check (Judging rules) — a
PASS-with-note is not one. A `BLOCKED` result never stops an interactive run: record it and walk on.
Both modes keep every other rule: preflight stops the campaign, and a `shared` env still needs the
operator's go before any write.

## Steps

1. **Preflight.** Run every check for the selected environment in `.anantys/qa.md`. On failure,
   **stop and tell the operator** — do not start services yourself, and do not "work around" a failed
   preflight. A campaign run on a half-up stack produces confident nonsense. Then read the plan's
   **Under test** line in `qa-plan.md`. If it names a branch/commit, verify the selected environment
   is actually serving that code before walking a single scenario — a plan derived from an unmerged
   PR, run against a stack serving `main`, reports green having verified nothing. How to verify it:
   - If the selected environment's block defines a **build identity** check, run it and compare its
     output to the plan's branch/commit. Never borrow another environment's probe — staging lags
     `main` between deploys. The environment **serves the code under test** when the deployed
     commit is the plan's head commit, **or contains it** — the PR has since merged and deployed:
     after a `git fetch`, `git merge-base --is-ancestor <head commit> <deployed commit>`, or, for a
     squash / rebase merge, the same test on the PR's merge commit (`gh pr view <ref> --json
     mergeCommit`). Record a match found this way as **satisfied by merge** (`<merge commit> in
     <deployed commit>`) in the run section, and leave the plan's line as it is. Otherwise — a
     different commit, a merged PR not yet deployed, or a probe that names only a branch such as
     `main` — **stop** and tell the operator what is deployed.
   - If it does not, **ask the operator which build that environment is serving and stop until they
     answer** — never infer it from the local checkout: `git branch --show-current` describes your
     working copy, not a remote dev stack or a deployed env.
   - Record the observed branch/commit in the `qa-runs.md` run section, beside `Subject:`, so a
     later reader can tell which build a green run was green against.

   The line is absent for a merged/deployed feature, and then there is nothing extra to check.

   **On a `shared` env, confirm the target before anything is written** — the pre-write
   confirmation in `reference/environments.md`. No go, no run.
2. **Reset — `local` only.** On a `local` environment, apply its reset procedure and confirm it took
   effect (a stale auth cookie or leftover cache silently invalidates every assertion that follows) —
   verify by observing the app, not by trusting the command's exit code. On a **`shared`**
   environment there is **NO reset**: never reset staging / preview / prod — reuse the operator's
   session and create any needed test data additively.
3. **Walk the scenarios in order**, in a real browser driven as the environment's `Driven by:`
   line says. On production, skip the unsafe scenario classes and record them
   `BLOCKED`. Per scenario: establish the precondition,
   perform the steps, then evaluate each assertion **individually**. In **interactive** mode the
   first *new* DEFECT ends the walk: finish that assertion's evidence, do steps 5–6, then hand off
   (see Run mode).
4. **Post a one-line result after each scenario.** The operator is watching; a campaign that
   reports only at the end is one where a bad reset costs you the whole run.
5. **Append a run section to `qa-runs.md`**, its header naming the environment and the mode —
   never overwrite prior runs. Prior runs are how a later reader recognises a re-occurrence.
6. Update the per-assertion status in `qa-plan.md` **for the selected environment only**, and only
   for the assertions this run walked; then refresh that environment's progress table.
7. **Finish:** write `qa-report.md` as `report` does (`reference/reporting.md`) — every run, both
   modes, so a defect this run saw PASS drops out of the brief. Interactive: you only reach this
   step if the walk met no new DEFECT, so say so. End the reply with the progress table.

## Judging rules

- **Behaviour over stores.** Judge from what the product shows, not from a database or cache you
  polled. Reads race the writes they observe, and tokens lag the events that invalidate them —
  both will lie to you at exactly the wrong moment.
- **Confirm your own preconditions before asserting.** A surviving session, a leftover record, or
  state you created yourself by re-walking a flow invalidates the result. A defect you caused is
  not a defect.
- **Screenshot anything visual**, and capture the URL plus any console/network error on every FAIL.
- **Never infer a PASS from a screen you did not reach.**
- Check every FAIL against the adjudication annotations in `qa-plan.md` **scoped to this environment
  or to `all`** before filing it. If it is already ruled intended or a known drift there, record it
  as PASS-with-note and move on. A ruling scoped to another environment never passes a FAIL here —
  file it, and mention the other env's ruling in the evidence so the operator can extend it.

## `retest` — the second pass after a fix

A full re-run after a fix pass is expensive and mostly re-confirms green. Instead:

1. Take from `qa-runs.md` every assertion whose latest result **on the selected environment** is
   FAIL or BLOCKED — a result recorded on another environment neither adds nor removes a case.
2. Add the **regression-risk set** around each fix — the assertions the fix could plausibly have
   broken, especially the ones an *over-fix* would break. A guard added to stop a wrong behaviour
   very often also suppresses the right one; assert the right one explicitly.
3. Add any assertion the operator flagged in `note` for this environment or for `all`.
4. Run that subset with the same rules as `run` — run mode included — and append a run section
   marked `retest` with its environment.

State the subset before running it, and say plainly what you are **not** re-testing.
