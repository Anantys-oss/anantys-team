# anantys-team

A small, vendor-neutral marketplace that turns Claude Code into a **specialized mini-team**.

The `anantys-team-agents` plugin gives Claude a set of **roles** — each one a way to put
*Claude + a real browser* to work, not just for writing code, but for piloting your tools
like a teammate would:

| Role | Invoke | Pattern | What they do |
|------|--------|---------|--------------|
| 🎨 **Frontend Designer** | skill `/anantys.design` | **Dev loop** | Refines a web page's design in a tight edit → reload → screenshot loop. The screenshot is the proof — never a "looks done" diff. |
| 📈 **Growth / Ops Analyst** | skill `/anantys.ops` | **Ops loop** | Drives the browser across live pages and SaaS dashboards (Search Console, Analytics, SERP) to produce a quantified, prioritized SEO/acquisition report with trend deltas. |
| 🐞 **Runtime Debugger** | skill `/anantys.debug` | **Ralf loop** | Reproduces a bug live, reads runtime signals (console, network, logs), fixes, and re-proves by observation — never by a plausible diff. |
| 🔀 **PR Reviewer** | skill `/anantys.review` | **Decision-ready review** | Cleanly reviews one agent-pushed PR branch: rebases on its base, summarizes only its own changes, assesses value/risk, and recommends Merge / Close / Skip / Audit — then waits for the human. |
| 🧭 **QA Campaign Runner** | skill `/anantys.qa` | **Campaign loop** | Turns a finished feature — a spec-kit `tasks.md`, a written brief, tracker issues, or a GitHub PR — into an executable browser campaign, runs it against a local dev stack or a deployed env (`--env staging`) recording PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED **per assertion**, accumulates operator rulings so a non-defect is never re-filed, and emits a fix brief for a fresh dev session. |
| 🔍 **Code Auditor** | agent `anantys.code-auditor` | **Adversarial review** | Runs in a fresh context after a large LLM-generated change and reports what it *omitted* — implicit contracts, edge cases, violated conventions the brief never spelled out. Restores cognitive control over mass-generated code. |
| 🧪 **Spec Tester** | agent `anantys.spec-tester` | **Spec-first testing** | Writes tests from the spec, deliberately *not* from the implementation, so they can fail against existing code — instead of just confirming what the model already wrote. |

**Skills** are invoked directly (`/anantys.design …`) — type `/anantys` to see the whole team.
**Agents** are dispatched as isolated subagents (via the `Task`/Agent tool) — a deliberately
*fresh context* so their review/testing isn't biased by the reasoning that produced the code.

Every role is **project-agnostic**: no hardcoded domains, paths, or design tokens. They ask
for what they need (a dev URL, a property, target queries) or infer it from the project.
More roles can be added over time without changing how you install the team.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
- A connected browser for the browser tools (e.g. the **Claude-in-Chrome** extension).

## Install

```bash
# 1. Add this marketplace
/plugin marketplace add Anantys-OSS/anantys-team

# 2. Install the pack (the whole team)
/plugin install anantys-team-agents@anantys-oss
```

Then invoke a skill directly:

```bash
/anantys.design  https://dev.example.com/pricing  — fix the hero spacing and button contrast
/anantys.ops     audit example.com, hub /blog, target "best running shoes" "trail shoes 2026"
/anantys.debug   the cart total is wrong on the checkout page — here's the repro
/anantys.review  review the branch agent/123-add-export — is it safe to merge?
/anantys.qa      init                     # one-off: describe your environments (local, staging…)
/anantys.qa      plan 206-checkout        # derive the campaign from specs/206-checkout/tasks.md
/anantys.qa      plan --from pr:42        # …or from a PR that's ready on GitHub
/anantys.qa      plan --brief feat.md     # …or from a hand-written feature brief
/anantys.qa      run                      # walk it in a real browser, on the local env (asks: autonomous or interactive)
/anantys.qa      run --env staging        # …or on a deployed env — never reset, additive only
/anantys.qa      report                   # fix brief to paste into a dev session
```

- **marketplace** = the catalog (the repo you add).
- **plugin** = the installable, versioned unit a user enables in one shot.
- **skills** = the actual capabilities Claude invokes.

## Adding a role

`marketplace.json` duplicates the plugin's name, version and description, and this README
enumerates every role — three places that silently go stale when a role is added or a
version bumped. Run the checker before pushing (stdlib only, no install):

```bash
python3 scripts/check_plugins.py
```

It fails on: a version/name/description mismatch between the two manifests, a skill whose
frontmatter `name` doesn't match its directory, an agent missing `name`/`description`/
`tools`/`model`, a role count in the description that the tree contradicts, and a role the
README never mentions. A `SKILL.md` over 200 lines is a *warning*, not an error: a skill
file is loaded in full on every invocation, so past that size the per-action detail belongs
in a `reference/` page the actions table links to. CI runs it on every push and pull request.
